  <h2>Hi! I'm Tucker and I just turned 9 years young. My hobbies include sleeping, jumping on mom,
    foraging for scraps in the kitchen, chasing squirrels...Ooo those pesky squirrels! Salmon jerky
    is my favorite, but I'll settle for beef jerky when I have to. I have a lot of thoughts. All day
    long I'm just thinking away and my brother, Steve, told me about blogging. I said, "Blogging?? What a great idea!"
    Steve always has the best ideas. Anyway, he says I talk to him too much so i'll share with you here instead!
